The First Prize in the International Architectural Design Competition 'Vydrica Bratislavske Podhradie, Blocks V5 V7'
<br><br><br><br>

The main problem for housing in the block v5 is the lack of the daylight in its lower parts. It results from large cubature of urban blocks and little space between them. Block v5 adhere to castle hill from the north side up to the 4th floor. For housing and apartaments the daylight is the most important thing.                            The northern part of the block v5 (v5.1) is divided into four towers. Each tower consist of 4 appartments of differentated areas. Each appartment in the tower is exposured toward three directions. High standard, splendid and high rental cost, long term living appartaments with marvelous view around. A really titbit for developers. At the top of the towers there are two storeyed appartments with terraces and the great view of the castle hill from north and the Dunabe from south. Below the towers there is the floor with 7 flats exposured only toward south. In the block v5.1 there are 23 appartments of total area 1935m2.                    The towers allow the castle hill and the green to "flow" into the inside of the quarter. They are a part of the hill landscape. They are the repetition of the general urban idea of vydrica  and their north west division. They are a kind of a fractal.

The southern part of the block v5 (v5.2) continues the 'four towers division' at the moderate, more urban, less landscapical level as they do not adhere directly to the castle hill. This part of the block is divided also in  four parts but the volume of these parts is bigger. There are not towers anymore but rather compacted blocks that contrast with the lightness of the towers. The green and space between towers 'flow' through opened staircases  that provide access to all apartaments in the v5.2 block. You can see a lot of  castle hill from here through the spaces betwean the towers.                From those four blocks one is especially distinct. The one that adhere to the water tower. This block consist of 3 two storeyed luxury appartments. Beautifull west exposure of this block and the neighbourhood of the water tower makes him unique. Most od the flats in v5.1 block are two storeyed flats. The flats at the highest floor of the block have terraces.  In the block v5.2 there are 21 appartments of total area 2065m2.                                                These two parts - the northern and the southern of the block v5 are connected with each other at 1st floor level - the leisure level. The northern-south communication of this two parts are simply the underground continuation of the overground division.                                Block v7 - the hotel is the biggest and the most compact volume of the complex. It is the most  urban as it belongs to the city completely. At the 5th floor of the hotel there are two sundecks and the swiming pool. Sundecks provide a beautiful southern view down to the Dunabe, the old city, and the nearly located historical water tower. The communication in the hotel is made around the hotel's atrium.              All the blocks are covered with intelligent facade - mechanical external blinds - that control the daylight in the rooms. The blinds are made of copper perforated sheets to which time will add patina.
