The Second Prize in the open design competition for a Public Toilet 
<br><br><br><br>

DESCRIPTION                                            Halftone is the reprographic technique that simulates continuous tone imagery through the use of equally spaced dots of varying size. 'Halftone' can also be used to refer specifically to the image that is produced by this process. Where continuous tone imagery (film photography, for example) contains an infinite range of colors or greys, the halftone process reduces visual reproductions to a binary image that is printed with only one color of ink. This binary reproduction relies on a basic optical illusionÂ—that these tiny halftone dots are blended into smooth tones by the human eye.      	The idea of this project is to use the halftone technique for presenting different images on the walls of the public toilet. The outer transparent walls are made of slight one color steel sheets spread between the top and the bottom construction frames. The equally spaced holes of varying size made in these steel sheets create halftone images that can be seen from the distance. The images on the walls of the public toilet can differ on the city, context of the place or the event.
