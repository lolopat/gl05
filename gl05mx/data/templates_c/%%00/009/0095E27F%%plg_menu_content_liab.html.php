Living Box system doesn't need prepared terrain to put up. It has its own open superstructure that makes it terrain-independent. Terrains elevations, stones or trees don't make a difference. They can penetrate the open structure space and become a part of it. Superstructure is transparent. Then the living space can occure in it. Living on the Earth doesn't only mean to subordinate the nature to us. It does mean coegzisting with it and leaving the beauty untouched.                                  Nothing in the Earth stays unchanged. Human needs change like seasons. So does LIVING BOX. You can add a space to the box in the way the superstructure allows you to do it, or you can remove it. It is never finished or completed.... It's just living. It can follow Your needs. LIVING BOX is not a particular flat but a system of solutions you can addopt to yourself. You can always change your box in the way You want, but you have to observe the rules.                             You cannot extend over superstructure (40m long, 4.60m width, and 5m height) To build a box you can use multiplication of 80cm (it is a module of prefabricated elements) You can only use LIVING BOX elements.                         Dimmensions of the LIVING BOX parts allow to transport it in standard containers. Walls, windows, slabs, technologic modules etc. are fully movable elements. As well as the superstructure, which can be put up and fold down into basic elements.                                                Proposal of uses:                              - Cheap flats for young people                   - Temporary houses for victims of natural          disasters                                         - Flats for mobile people (contemporary              ?nomads?)                                       - People who want to express their indyviduality - People with indyvidual requirements
