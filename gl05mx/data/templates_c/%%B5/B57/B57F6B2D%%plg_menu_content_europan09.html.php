DESCRIPTION                                                                                            RUMBULA
The project site is an unwritten page strongly affected by the nature, situated in borders of the city of Riga which is a city of very strict urbanism, composed of many typical urban quarters. Typical urban quarters, invented quite a long time ago, solved the problems of the past times are used up to now as universal urban solution with more or less success. But time has passed by and the technology reasons for which this form was invented seems to be vanishing. The quarter now abandoned by the reason of its creation starts to be the abstract form. 
Is the place dedicated to the project an accurate pole to continue this abstract game without reasons? The project is orientated toward creating artificial landscapes of symbolic meaning. Four different artificial landscapes were determined and put together into one complexity. Each one is defined by different features including physical elements such as landforms, elements of flora and of course architecture.
'THE CITY'
'The City' is a multifunctional structure based on the orthogonal grid. It is composed of limited number of subunit types. The grid and strict order is associated with urban landscape and city life. The structure is never finished and can change its congestion or functions to fit current needs. The basic subunit types offers different types of offices, retail, leisure and recreation units including void subunits in the function of urban squares and open spaces with greenery.
Each subunit of 'The City' landscape is based on the 32x32m square and is divided into three parts. The underground level is common for all subunits types and consist the underground car parking. The ground floor of all subunit types is designed as the retail function area and access to all the upper levels. The upper levels depend of subunit function can accommodate different types of offices, education units, leisure and recreation functions including sport facilities and cinemas.
The construction of the subunit over the ground level is limited to four massive columns in the corners which support vierendell beams structure applied on the even floors. This implicate the fact that the odd floors are totally free from vertical construction.
The maximum capacity of proposed grid of 'The City' structure is 192,512 sq m of multifunctional area and 96,256 sq m of car parkings. The presented in project structure arrangement has 41,984 sq m of retail, 93,388 sq meters of offices,  6144 sq m of leisure and recreation and 96,256 sq m of parking. 'The City' area refers to Rumbula Plan plots number 19 and 8.
FOREST AND THE HOUSING TOWERS 
Next to the multifunctional structure the second artificial landscape is created. The architecture here uses minimal footprints and the maximum height allowed by Rumbula Plan. This small land occupation created by high multihousing towers allows us to make the forest restoration. Existing parts of the forest and solitudes are refilled with new trees and continue ecosystem is recreated here. The forest cross the entire study site and connects the forest ecosystem outside the site. The forest itself is an open recreation space with the system of paths serves as communication for entire part of the project especially for multihousing towers.
Tower is constructed of 23 housing stories. Each story can accommodate from 5 to 8 different apartments on the total floor area of 572 sq m. The apartments are one and two stories apartments and their area varies from 40 sq m to 105 sq m. The floor area of each tower is 13,156 sq m and the number of apartments in one tower can vary from 115 to 184. In each tower the common social places can be implemented by 'taking off' one of the apartment. Under towers, the car parkings are located in the underground. 
The total area of flats for the 'Towers' district is 171,028 sq m with the number of apartments varying from 1495 to 2392 dependently on project strategy. The 'Forest and the Housing Towers' area is located in plots number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 19 according to Rumbula Plan.
SUPERSTRUCTURES
Next to the forest landscape is the space of transition between the waterfront and inner parts of Rumbula. For that reasons the priority here was easy access and crossing in the direction perpendicular to the river flow. Also the high density housing according to Rumbula Plan should be implemented here. Following this assumption the idea of narrow, long and high housing superstructures were born to maintain views and communication flow between waterfront and inner parts of Rumbula. Superstructures raised on high pillars free the ground below them. The objects are located along and over the terrain object that accommodate underground parking for the area.
Superstructure is constructed of 15 housing stories. There are 8 different types of apartments including one and two stories apartments, and their area varies from 78 sq m to  147 sq m. Each superstructure is perforated by vast voids which serves as common social places and reduce the mass of the volume. The presented building is constructed of 100 apartments of total area 11,880 sq m.
The total area of flats for the 'Superstructures' district is 59,400 sq m in 500 apartments in example. The 'Superstructures' area is located in plots number 1, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12 according to Rumbula Plan.
WATERFRONT 
The waterfront is the fourth component of the project. It spreads in the vast strip along the river. Opposite to first three artificial landscapes the waterfront is intended for low density housing. This assumption allow to create traditional 4 stories multifamily housing. Buildings are located on orthogonal grid based on 20x20m square module. The grid is filled by houses that are designed in groups of few with the free access space between groups. This configuration assure good communication in all directions.
The aesthetic of waterfronts housing recall the local building tradition. Each housing unit is composed of two types of apartments: one story apartment with area of 54 sq m and two stories apartments with area of 108 sq m. The number of apartments in one housing unit varies from 4 to 8.
There are 40 multifamily housing units on the site, with 600 sq m each. Total area of 'Waterfront' housing is 24,000 sq m, and the total number of flats can vary from 160 to 320, dependently on configuration of the apartments in the units. The waterfront area is located in plots number 9, 10, 11 and 12 according to Rumbula Plan.
ADDITIONAL OBJECTS AND COMMUNICATION
Open air leisure and sport infrastructure is located in the east part of the site among the forest landscape.
By the river, the marina and the harbour are located. They continue the waterfront aesthetic which is a paradigm of this landscape.
The pedestrians communication is allowed all over the green area which is reinforced by perforated composite ground panels in the areas of the heaviest pedestrian traffic.
